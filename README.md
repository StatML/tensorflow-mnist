Tensorflow MNIST example using Dataset API
==========================================

This is accompanying code to my [blog post introducing the new Dataset API](https://cjalmeida.net/blog/tensorflow-mnist/).

Though the focus is showcasing `tf.data.Dataset` and friends, the whole code is hopefully well documented and easy
to grasp. You can find the dependencies in the `environment.yml` (Anaconda environment definition file).
